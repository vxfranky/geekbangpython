Data type: INTEGER(int), FLOATING(float), STRING(str), BOOLEAN(bool).
Use command type(DATA) in python console to test data type.

SEQUENCE TYPES:
    string    "abcd"
    list      [0, "abcd"]           Can be changed if needed
    tuple     ("abc", "def")        Generally cannot be changed

SEQUENCE OPERATIONS:
    relation    in / not in
    join        +
    duplicate   *
    slice       [:]

â˜… LAMBDA
    lambda arguments : expression

COMPREHENSION
    new_list = [expression for member in iterable (if conditional)]

FILE HANDLING
    open()                          Only one mode can be applied on each open() method.
                                    r: READONLY. Open for reading in text mode. Default mode.
                                    w: WRITE. Truncate file if already exists.
                                    x: EXCLUSIVE CREATION. The same as w but raises an exception if the file already
                                       exists, in order to avoid accidentally truncate/append an existing file.
                                    a: APPEND. Insert texts at the current file stream position, default 0.
    read()
    readline()
    seek()                          Set current position(cursor). seek(offset, whence), whence:
                                    0: absolute position, 1: relative to current position, 2: relative to the end
    write()
    close()                         File must be closed after handling. Any changes will be applied when file close.
